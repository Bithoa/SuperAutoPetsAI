How to run:
    The program can be run by simply running the main program, and following the prompts given. If you want to run from
    a pre-existing model from a previous run, update the PATH variable in main.py to the address of the model of your
    choice.

Logging:
    The stats of runs are also included here, inside the checkpoint folder. Each folder is named after the time it took
    and contains both the intermittantly saved models in .chkpt files and graphs for the runs progression.
